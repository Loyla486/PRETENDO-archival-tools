# Meta Data
This script will store the leaderboard data in the `data` directory. Each folder inside `data` is the leaderboards event ID

- 1 = BMX
- 5 = 100m

- 9 = 4 x 100m Relay
- 10 = Javelin Throw
- 11 = Triple Jump
- 12 = Swimming
- 13 = Equestrian
- 14 = Archery

Each event folder contains a `rankings.json.gz` file. Due to the large size of this data, the data is compressed with gzip at level 9. When decompressed, each file is a JSON array of ranking objects

## Notes

1. Not every event name is known. The ID is stored as well as the name. If the name is not known, `name` will be `Unknown`
2. Not every character name is known. The ID is stored as well as the name. If the name is not known, `name` will be `Unknown`
3. Nintendo seems to have cases where several records have the same rank position. No filtering is done to prevent this, the data is saved exactly as Nintendo sends it
4. The character and flag the user was using at the time of making the record can differ from their favorite character and flag. As such it is stored separately
